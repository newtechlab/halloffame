Invented programming

Envisioned the true potential of computers
#why
Lady Ada Lovelace the daughter of the infamous poet Lord Byron was a truly gifted individual. Not only was she a natural mathematical genious, she also served as the lead developer for the seemingly nutty inventor Charles Babbage.
Babbage had taken on an truly gargantuan project, to build the worlds first general purpose computing machine. Babbage and Ada did build the pre-cursor to the general one, but sadly the Analytical Engine was never built.
You just have to imaging a mechanical computer the size of a freight train, fuled by a furnace, and operated through cranks and levers - talk about the ultimate steam-punk computer! 
Ada's work would go on to inspire titans of the future, and was truly the seed of our modern era of computing. This list would not exist if it hadn't been for the lovely lady Ada - so naturally she belongs here.

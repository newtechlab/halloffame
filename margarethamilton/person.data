Coined the term Software Engineering
Wrote the software for the on-board computer for the Apollo space program
She literally put a man on the moon
#why
Wov talk about a titan from the engineering industry. Margaret worked on the Apollo space program and wrote all the software for the on-board computer. 
One keen feature was it's error correction routines that she implemented after her four year old kid accidently put the computer into a failing state. 
This feature proved quite handy when the Apollo astronauts triggered the same error on their lunar approach. How many people have LEGO sets made of them? 
She also holds a Presidential Medal of Freedom - now come on - she is a rock star! She is on the list nuff said!

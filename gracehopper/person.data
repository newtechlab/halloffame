#why
Now where do we begin with Amazing Grace Hopper. She started working with computers at the tender age of 38 - proving that it is never too late to start with technology.
She pioneered the idea of using human like language to program a computer - an idea that was not easilly accepted at the time. Her bosses thought that was a horrible idea. Turns out she had the last laugh on that topic.
Her contributions to modern computing, combined with an awesome take on nano-seconds, rightfully earns her a spot on our list. She reached the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy, and has a guided missile destroyer named after her - need we say more?

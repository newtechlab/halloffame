Wrote the algorithm that captured the first real image of a black hole.
Compiled from data gathered by telescopes all over the world - essentially turning the earth into a giant telescope.

Female computer scientist started out as being the standard, then went extinct, but now they are returning.
But forget about gender for a minute, because great computer scientists are a rare bunch, that do not come around that often. 
Katie belongs to both categories. She managed to become an expert in computer graphics processing at a very young age, and her efforts at the Event Horizons project, consolidating massive - and we mean MASSIVE - amounts of data into this historic picture of a black hole puts her on the map of history. 
She will join the ranks Turing, Hopper, Djikstra and Von Neumann into computing history. This earns her a spot on our list.

First African-American first lady
Inspires equality in the tech industry
An award winning author
#why
Most know Michelle Obama as the first lady of the USA when Barrack Obama held office. And yes, she was the first African-American first lady - which sort of put diversity on the map around the world.
But she is also a lawyer, author, and mother among other things. She continues to fight for equality, diversity and healthcare. And her book - Becomming - became the best selling book of 2018 after only two weeks.
An amazing person, we need her on this list.

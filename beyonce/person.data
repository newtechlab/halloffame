#why
Beyonce is a talented woman. Her voice has been dubbed one of the most compelling instruments of all time. She started out in the hugely successful trio Destiny's Child, then went on to build one of the most successful musical solo careers of all time.
Not only as a recording artist, she has also crossed over to other arenas - something her Golden Globe nomination for best actress for the movie Dreamgirls proves. Did I mention she also did the soundtrack for that movie?
VH1 ranked her as number 3 of the Greatest Women in Music through all time - naturally she belongs on this list.
